# Warcraft Integration Module for Drupal #

## About ##
This project is a World of Warcraft guild module for the Drupal content management system. Drupal can be downloaded from drupal.org.

This project has started as a learning project for me to get acquainted with the workings of Drupal and to refresh and extend my PHP skills.

## When will it be released? ##
Someday, perhaps never. It's just some learning project to me. And if it's ready then it will be before WoW 4.0.

## Download ##
I don't recommend any guild website to use this module just yet unless you want to help and make this module actually work.
But if you really want to take a peak, you may. You can download it from the source tab.
